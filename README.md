- Tested primarily with Google Chrome.
- All important information on how to handle the BrightSign script can be found as comments within the script itself.
- Make sure your computer can handle multiple media players running at the same time; otherwise, it could cause lag.
- (ONLY Mac-User): If you use macOS and an audio interface with more than 2 outputs, set it as the default output device (in your OS) to access more then 2 channels in the software.
